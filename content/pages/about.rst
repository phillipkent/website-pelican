I am a full-time technical writer working for the cloud computing division of Interoute_ in London.

In spare time I am an education/technology consultant with `Design Science`_ (DS). DS is an editorial design and education agency aimed at bringing science and design closer together.

Samples of my programming activities are at Github_ and OpenProcessing_.

I do private mathematics tuition. I specialise in secondary maths (KS3 and GCSE) and helping teachers and trainees to prepare for the `QTS Numeracy Test`_.  I am also available for proof reading and editing of academic writing (theses, dissertations, papers) or technical writing.

Other things I have done
========================

`Art of Anamorphosis`_ is an ongoing (though mostly off, lately) maths-art education project which started as an exhibition and website in 2000.

About this site
===============

I am moving this site from a Drupal-based dynamic site to a Pelican-based static site. Please excuse appearance and limited content while the work is being done.
