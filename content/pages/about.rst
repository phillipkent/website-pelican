:summary: About text for frontpage

I am a full-time technical writer in the IT sector, working for the cloud computing division of Interoute_ in London.

Samples of my programming activities are at Github_ and OpenProcessing_.

In spare time I work as a consultant for the science communication agency `Design Science`_. Current projects include designing the communication elements for the medical engineering research project MetaboLight_.

I do private mathematics tuition. I specialise in secondary maths (KS3 and GCSE) and helping teachers and trainees to prepare for the `QTS Numeracy Test`_.  I am also available for proofreading and editing of academic writing (theses, dissertations) or technical writing.

Other things I have done
========================

`Art of Anamorphosis`_ is an ongoing (though mostly off, lately) maths-art education project which started as an exhibition and website in 2000.

About this site
===============

I am moving this site from a Drupal-based dynamic site to a `Pelican`_-based static site. Please excuse appearance and limited content while the work is being done.
