I am a full-time technical writer working for the cloud computing division of Interoute in London.

In spare time I am an education/technology consultant with Design Science (DS). DS is an editorial design and education agency aimed at bringing science and design closer together. Among other projects, I was co-editor, author and programmer/designer for the Litmus Paper newspaper published at the Cheltenham Science and Literature Festivals in 2012. Code developed in Processing for Litmus Paper can be accessed via an OpenProcessing collection.

Art of Anamorphosis, an ongoing (though mostly off, lately) maths-art education project.

Samples of my programming activities are at Github (and Gist) and OpenProcessing.

I do private mathematics tuition. I specialise in secondary maths (KS3 and GCSE) and helping teachers and trainees to prepare for the QTS Numeracy Test.  I am also available for proof reading and editing of academic writing (theses, dissertations, papers)  or technical writing.
