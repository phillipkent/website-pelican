:summary: About text for frontpage

I am a full-time API technical writer for the software and consulting company `Palantir Solutions`_ in London.

Samples of my programming activities are at Github_ and OpenProcessing_.

In spare time I work as a consultant for the science communication agency `Design Science`_.

.. Current projects include designing the communication elements for the medical engineering research project MetaboLight_.

I do private mathematics tuition. I specialise in secondary maths (KS3 and GCSE) and helping teachers and trainees to prepare for the `QTS Numeracy Test`_.  I am also available for proofreading and editing of academic writing (theses, dissertations) or technical writing.

Other things I have done
========================

`Art of Anamorphosis`_ is a maths-art education project which started as an exhibition and website in 2000.
