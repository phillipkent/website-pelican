:summary: About text for frontpage

I am a full-time technical writer (specialising in API documentation) for the engineering software company `Aucerna`_ in London.

Samples of my programming activities are on Github_.

.. and OpenProcessing_.

In spare time I do occasional work as a consultant for the science communication agency `Design Science`_.

.. Current projects include designing the communication elements for the medical engineering research project MetaboLight_.

I do freelance work on proofreading and editing of academic writing (theses, dissertations) or technical writing. I also do private mathematics tuition: I specialise in secondary maths (KS3 and GCSE), and helping teachers and trainees to prepare for the `QTS Numeracy Test`_.  

Other things I have done
========================

In a previous career I was an academic researcher in mathematics education and worked at
the University of London Institute of Education, Imperial College London, and the University of Sussex. I got a
PhD in Applied Mathematics at Imperial College in 1992, and an MA in Mathematics Education at the Institute
of Education in 1999.

`Art of Anamorphosis`_ is a maths-art education project which started as an exhibition and website in 2000.
